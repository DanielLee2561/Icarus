# Icarus (Max/Unity/C#)	2023 Jan - 2023 Apr
Developed software for live performance video control at the 2024 UBC Bang! Festival.
Represented constellations as graphs with nodes and edges in Unity. Each star can be lit by the performer using commercial hardware with threshold and event handlers.
Invoked coroutine with linear interpolation in C# to transition between skyboxes. Further applied to modulating bloom with HDR to control the brightness of each star over time.
